# Tic-Tac-Toe


Technology - JAVA (Oops Concept)
It's a simple game for two players (one is the person and the other is the computer), 
X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in 
placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. 
The game does not allow the marking of two letters at the same time in the same column, 
if it occurs it shows a message. The game is developed by me in MVC architecture using 
the object-oriented concept.
